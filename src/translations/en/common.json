And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!  Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet."
